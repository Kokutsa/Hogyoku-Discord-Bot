  "_**The path of the sword is not an easy one. You will face times when you wish to give up. You will feel as though you can go no further. But that is the true test of your strength. Push forward with all your heart and fight with everything you've got. For every defeat, your heart will grow stronger. Don't stop, don't quit, and give it your all every moment you have. That is the difference between a warrior of the blade... and the rest.**_\n—Tensa Zangetsu",
  "_**Sometimes I question the point of it all. The fighting, the killing... If it's so meaningless, why do we do it? Is it for a reason? Or is it for nothing? I don't know. But when I look at myself, and see these hands stained with blood... I don't think I've ever known another way to live. But I guess I have known one thing: what it means to protect someone. To love someone. For that, I am grateful. It's a feeling I never thought I'd have.**_\n—Ulquiorra Cifer",

  "_**Don't compare yourself to others. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is yourself. No one can be you, and no one can live your life like you do. So stop worrying about what others are doing and focus on what you want. You make your own path and make your own mark on the world. And when you stay true to yourself and make your mark, you'll find the true meaning of 'warrior' in your heart.**_\n—Ikumi Unagiya",
  "_**In battle, there is no room for doubt. If you second-guess, all is lost. This is true of every fight, whether it be with a sword or with words. When you show doubt, you have already lost your chance to win. So have faith, fight fearlessly, and always believe in yourself. Let your inner strength guide you towards victory and never let your confidence falter. Be strong, be proud, and never back down from a challenge.**_\n—Yachiru Unohana",
  "_**No matter who you are, everyone feels fear. It's what makes us human. It also means that everyone is capable of being afraid. I have known fear and I have overcome it. And if you can find out why you are afraid, then you can overcome it too. That's why courage isn't the absence of fear, it's the decision to stand despite it. So don't be afraid. Let the fear flow through you, and hold your head proud.**_\n—Genryusai Yamamoto",
  "_**In some ways, this world can be tough and unforgiving. But every once in a while, the world will also remind you how kind it can be. Sometimes it's not as hopeless as things seem, and sometimes it takes just a single moment of kindness to bring about big changes. Keep an open heart because it's the small gestures we do that shape our world and make it a better place. And know that when you're feeling low, you don't have to face it alone. There will always be someone who is there to lend a helping hand when you need it most.**_\n—Rukia Kuchiki"
